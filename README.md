# Huffman Coding for Lossless Data Compression

## Overview

Data compression is crucial for minimizing storage space and optimizing data transmission. **Huffman coding** is a widely used algorithm that efficiently compresses data while preserving its original content. This repository showcases a Go implementation of Huffman coding, providing a solution for lossless data compression.
## Ongoing Updates

This implementation is a work in progress and will be continuously updated for enhancements and improvements. Updates may include bug fixes, optimizations, and additional features.

## Problem Statement

In many applications, data needs to be transmitted or stored efficiently without losing any information. Traditional encoding methods often assign fixed-length codes to characters, which can be inefficient for data with varying character frequencies. This inefficiency leads to unnecessary space consumption and slower data transmission.

## Huffman Coding Solution

**Huffman coding** addresses the inefficiency of fixed-length encoding by assigning variable-length codes to characters. It achieves this by constructing a binary tree, known as the Huffman tree, based on the frequency of characters in the input data.

### Key Components

1. **Character Frequency Analysis**: The algorithm analyzes the input data to determine the frequency of each character.
2. **Huffman Tree Construction**: Using the character frequencies, a Huffman tree is built, where characters with higher frequencies have shorter codes.
3. **Code Generation**: Traversing the Huffman tree generates unique variable-length codes for each character.

## Implementation Overview

### Features

- **Alphabet Counting**: Counts the frequency of each character in the input data.
- **Huffman Tree Construction**: Constructs the Huffman tree based on character frequencies.
- **Code Generation**: Generates Huffman codes for efficient data representation.
